# Multidisciplinary-Project-CE-3004-

The following repository contains the code implementation for the Multidisciplinary Project - a module that is taken by all students from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University. 

In this project, a robot is constructed ad programmed to autonomously explore a maze that is filled with obstaces, create a map of the explored arena and compute the fastest path from the start to the end of the arena without colliding into any obstacles. Furthermore, sensors are incorporated on
